# Simple Object Manager

The Simple Object Manager (`Som`) is a project that tends to create an object containing methods helping you on manipulating data object representation.\

By default, this object can be available on a global scale (window) and can be instanciated multiple times, so you can handle different instances of the `Som`.

The goal of this library is to facilitate the object management for less advanced users that have to deal with complex data representation (Objects, Arrays interlocked, Set or nested Objects).\
Working with objects can be cumbersome and bring challenges on your data collection implementation. These chalenges leads usually to different approaches to solve them, it creates workarounds or replication of codes.

This [page](Simple_Object_Manager_Origin.md) will provide you the origin and philosophy behind the Simple Object Manager(`Som`).\

## Methods

This documentation will provide you with information on how to instantiate the `Som` class and the different methods available from the `Som` instance.\

If you are more of hands-on test enthusiast, you can directly see the [cheat sheet](Simple_Object_Manager_CheatSheet.md)
