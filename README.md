# XDM Object Manager

The XDM Object Manager (`Xom`) is a project that tends to create a object that contains methods associated to it and that helps the management of the XDM representation of the data.\

This object can be available on a global scale (window) and can be instanciated multiple time, so you can handle different instance of the `Xom`.

The goal of this library is to facilitate the object management for client side library, especially the AEP Web SDK, where generating a clean object is crucial. 

You can find more information on that project and the different methods supported in the following sections.
